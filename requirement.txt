Target: Xposed hooking method to change, fake, spoof information about the device
like (IMEI, BRAND, BUILD ID, PRODUCT, MODEL, DEVICE, Hardware Serial, PHONE NUMBER, SIM IMSI, BOOTLOADER, FRINTERPRINT)
all the data that to be new device with new info.
I need an app written in Kotlin (highly recommended) that when i run command in shell,
it will change info for me.

Technology used: Kotlin app in gradle, YukiHookApi in https://github.com/HighCapable/YukiHookAPI

I want UI like ./img.png so that i can see the props and i can changed it. I also want to call this app in terminal,
it will change all props for me, no need to pass props to this command.
We'll request to this site #fetch https://www.myfakeinfo.com/mobile/get-android-device-information.php to get all
information about random information and we based from that so change the information in my device.
